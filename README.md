# Roblox Realtime Corruptor
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8ava/roblox-realtime-corruptor/indev/exampleinit.lua"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Copy-rRTC-33eb4f.svg" alt="Download Badge" /></a>

This Luau script essentially mimics the [Real-Time Corruptor](https://redscientist.com/rtc) by Redscientist. 

It works by changing values from every recognized Instance type in a Roblox game at random. This results in pretty similar outcomes  minus some more situational things such as events. This runs under script executors, and is backwards compatible with Roblox's Luau interpreter. 

In the current state this is lacking many things, such as a way to make stockpiles, load, or even capure your random seed. 
Eventually i would like this will be much more modular on the backend, complete with a user interface, and the ability to load and save states. However, none of these are currently the case. I had to stop working on this project forcefully as a result of the Byfron update, and the recent Windows Store patch. I could still test this in studio, however i have no way of checking if this would still run under an executor's interpreter. As a result this project has been essentially scrapped, and only enters my mind when i watch an occasional video. 

> I implore you to add onto this project, as i am busy with other things constantly.
