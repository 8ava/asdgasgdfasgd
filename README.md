#### All current work is being done in [this](https://github.com/8ava/roblox-realtime-corruptor/tree/indev) branch, because the script is not user friendly yet.

This lua script essentially mimics the [Real-Time Corruptor](https://redscientist.com/rtc) by Redscientist. It works by changing values from every recognized Instance Type in a Roblox game at random. This results in pretty similar outcomes  minus some more situational things such as events. This runs under script executors, and is backwards compatible with Roblox's luau interpreter.

In the current state this is lacking many things such as a way to make stockpiles, load, or even capure your random seed. **I implore you to add onto this project, as i am busy with other things constantly.** Eventually i would like this will be much more modular on the backend, and complete with a User Interface, and the ability to load and save states. However, none of these are currently the case. 

### list of things that are not modified currently
- non module scripts
- variables
- functions  *sort of*

***

i will add something to the main branch once i get a gui up, or someone else wants to do it for me :3
